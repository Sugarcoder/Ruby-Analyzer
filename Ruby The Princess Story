Once upon a time, there lived a princess named Ruby. 
She was raised by her grandmother 
and they lived in a small village. 
Like some of Disney princesses, 
she was not born and raised in a castle for many reasons. 
For one, her parents (the King and Queen of Rubyland) was killed by an evil villain named, "Python", when she was a baby. 
Fortunately, her grandmother and her escaped unharmed. 
However, Python took over their castle and currently rules the land. 
Therefore, they are hiding for the sake of their safety.
